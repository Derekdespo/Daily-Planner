# Daily-Planner
For the daily planner I began by tapping into the moment.js api to get a clocl on the screen.
The timer on the clock didn't work right away so I added a function that allowed for the clock to refresh itself on one second intervals
After that, I went into the html file and attempted to build up some rows and columns, which came out looking okay.
I slapped IDs on almost everything in attempt to single it out later.
Then I needed to set up a function with a conditional to determine the color of the time slot depending out what time in the day it is.
This will need a page refresh to actually show should you leave the page open through the hour.
I needed to figure out a way to get the user input in the textarea to save in local storage, I think I managed to do that, but I struggled with retrieving it back from the storage accurately. 
I will continue to work on this page in hopes to get the local storage fully operational.
